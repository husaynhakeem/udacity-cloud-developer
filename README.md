# Udagram Image Filtering Microservice

This is the second assignment from [the Udacity cloud developer nanodegree course](https://www.udacity.com/course/cloud-developer-nanodegree--nd9990). It's a Node-Express application which runs a simple script to process images, and is deployed using AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

### Testing the image filter endpoint
- Base url: http://image-filter-dev-dev2.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/filteredimage
- Query key: image_url
- Query value: An image's url

Example: http://image-filter-dev-dev2.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/filteredimage?image_url=https://images.theconversation.com/files/93616/original/image-20150902-6700-t2axrz.jpg
